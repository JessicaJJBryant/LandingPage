      <h2>What is Sovey?</h2>
      <p>Sovey is a gentle breeze in a meadow and mother sun encouraging new growth. Sovey is everything soft and lovey;
        that's sovey. Sovey was penned about 70 years ago when my little cousin couldn't say the word lovely. She said
        "sovey" instead. I wasn't much older than she was, so when Grandma pulled me close for a hug and a "Grandma
        loves you, honey," I knew what sovey felt like. Sovey is soft and lovey skin. My Sovey products to help keep
        skin soft and lovey are a mixture of herbs that can heal skin fast and keep it that way. Throughout my long life
        (I'm 73-years-young now), I've learned a lifetime from my herbalist ancestors and from ALL (ok, maybe not all)
        the books in Kentucky which herbal remedies work for which skin issue. With full FDA approval and a full money
        back guarantee, what are you waiting for? Soften Up With Sovey.</p>

        <h2 id="story">Who is Sovey?</h2>
        <p>The Sovey Story starts with all soft, lovey skin but also with a specific grandma: I'm Dipsi: a Mama,
          grandma, and new great-mama. Ending my corporate rat race was easy after 50 years, and I enjoyed just sleeping
          in for a few weeks. Then, magically, the opportunity to move to a piece of Kentucky heaven in the Red River
          Gorge appeared. The little cabin I built among the trees with meadows, woods, and flowing creeks nearby
          inspired me to expand my herbal healing hobby into a business. Growing, harvesting, wildcrafting, srying, and
          converting herbs and flowers into healing formulas is a joy. I spend my days doing what I love so that you can
          be sovey too!</p>

      <h2>Herbalist Adventures<h2>
          <p>Sovey offers in house, and online training seminars to aid you in identifying, and harvesting, and
            developing healing formulas of wild herbs and flowers without harming nature. Annually in early summer,
            we host a gathering for budding and fully bloomed herbalists. Presenters are carefully selected to
            provide a wide array of learning opportunities. Vendors provide a variety of products to enhance your
            hobby or business. For the two day and two night gathering, we provide free primitive camping and dinner
            at the bonfire the second night, flavor boosted with herbs gathered on some of the nature walk seminars.
            Check back after the pandemic for our next adventure or join our mailing list. Private herbalist
            adventures can also be scheduled (please call or email).</p>
